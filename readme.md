# Simple Decentralised Insurance: Skeleton

This is the skeleton of a smart contract-based simple insurance web application, powered by [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/ "Ethereum"), [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).

## Project Setup

You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). In this setup, we will be using Node Package Manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)).

1. Clone this repository to your local computer by running:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/wpranata/simple-decentralised-insurance.git
```

2. Install all dependencies within the [protocol skeleton](./protocol-skeleton):

```zsh
cd protocol-skeleton
npm install
```

3. Don't forget to do the same thing to the [frontend skeleton](./frontend-skeleton):

```zsh
cd frontend-skeleton
npm install
```

4. All done!
